# Portfolio
Welcome to Portfolio, a small PHP Portfolio software I've made.

It has all the essentials and is easy to use!

* Markdown files go to /pages
* CSS files work by this way:
    1. Includes global.css
    2. Includes the css file that has the name of your page!
* Other things go to /res and can be included like so: `/file.png`

Example: `![Je vais tout bruler](https://portfolio.141412.xyz/example.png)`

![Je vais tout bruler](https://portfolio.141412.xyz/example.png)

[Go to crap page](/cool)
